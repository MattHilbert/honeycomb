<h3>Tell a story</h3>
<p>The best photos tell a story, and the best stories are human stories. </p>

   <h3>Keep it natural</h3>
<p>The best photos feel natural. No fakery, photoshoppery or fancy filters.</p>

         <h3>Put a name to a face</h3>
<p>Whenever possible call out the names of the people in the photos. This will make them even more real, and recognisable.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
         <h3>Made by Redgate</h3>
<p>There are tons of talented photographers at Redgate, so many we have a photo club. We always prefer photos to be taken by a Redgater.</p>

<h2>UX recruitment flyer</h2>

   <br>
   
<h3>Real</h3> 
<p>The UX team's weekly meeting - although this was a staged photo it was still a real UX team weekly meeting. The meeting was held in a place where there was better lighting and a more interesting angle could be achieved.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>You can tell there is plenty of discussion and thinking going on, everyone looks engaged.</p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>The documents are clearly real, and the people are in natural poses - holding a pen, leaning over to peer at a diagram, or clasping a coffee cup.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Lighting is natural. It's high resolution.</p>

   <br>
   <br>
        
<h3>Real</h3> 
<p>From SQL in the City 2014</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>There are several stories in one photo, lots going on, but there's still a focal point. </p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>Captures the mood with lots of focused people interacting with each other, a Redgater and a tool demo, and doesn't look staged.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Lighting is natural. It's high resolution.</p>

   <h2>Tool demo</h2>

   <br>
   <br>
        
<h3>Real</h3> 
<p>From SQL in the City 2014</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Lots of people crowding to get a tool demo.</p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>Captures the mood with people focused on the tool, and an intense look from David Priddle.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Lighting is natural, but oversaturated in places (though it does put our user in a spotlight, which is a nice message).</p>

   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Book-of-Redgate.png" alt="Book of Redgate 2012" title="Book of Redgate 2012" class="js-svg">

   <br>
   <br>
        
<h3>Stock images exception</h3> 
<p>These pictures of animals are stock images. We couldn't reasonably have taken these ourselves and if we did they would have turned out the same.</p>
