                <p>Frameworks are not evil, they save time, fix cross browser compatibility issues and make us think in new ways. But, they do add overhead so before we jump in bed with them, see above.</p>
                
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>There are several CSS frameworks available, and it&#8217;s on our list to investigate them, and decide whether it would benefit us to use one in our development.</p>
                
                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>We should only use one &#8220;Core&#8221; javascript framework &#8211; <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Additional libraries for specific tasks not handled by the Core framework can be added if they meet the above requirements e.g. Effects &amp; animation, SVG, Charting, Shims (Add support for features that aren&#8217;t natively supported by some browsers) &#8211; Do check the jQuery documentation though, it can do lots, and lots, of cool stuff.</p>
