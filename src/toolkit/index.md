                	<p>Honeycomb is a set of standards, conventions and tools for building websites at Redgate.*</p>
                    <p>Honeycomb aspires to create a unified style and experience for Redgate websites, and make web development at Redgate faster.</p>

                    <h2>Who is Honeycomb for?</h2>
                    <p>This standard is for experienced designer / developers.</p>
                    <p>A secondary audience is the less experienced web maintenance team who want to mark up pages using existing components.</p>

                    <h2>What are these pages?</h2>
                    <p>This is a documentation website, code library and style guide, which lives inside the web project it documents, using the live project styles and scripts.</p>

					<h2>Want to see some source code?</h2>
					<p>Want to head straight to the source code for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript components? All our Honeycomb code is available in our GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/red-gate/ingeniously-simple-web" target="_blank">https://github.com/red-gate/ingeniously-simple-web</a>.</p>
