				<h2>Typographic scale and baseline</h2>
				<p>The base font size for the website is left at 100% (which is 16px by default in most browsers).</p>
				<p>All font-sizes are calculated as REMs, with a pixel fallback value.</p>
				<p>The basic set of styles are based on a typographic scale of 11, 14, 16, 18, 24, and 32.</p>
				<p>All components align to an 8 pixel square baseline grid and type aligns to a 4px grid, within reason.</p>

				<p>Daniel goes back and sits by one of the windows – these are undershot so that he can look straight down and see Minerva’s wake being born in a foamy collision around the rudder. He opens a small hatch below a window and drops out a Fahrenheit thermometer on a string. It is the very latest in temperature measurement from Europe – Enoch presented it to him as a sort of party favour. He lets it bounce through the surf for a few minutes, then hauls it in a takes a reading.</p>

				<p>He’s been trying to perform this ritual every four hours – the objective being to see if there’s any rumour that the North Atlantic is striped with currents of warm water. He can present the data to the Royal Society if God-willing he reaches London.</p>

				<h2>(Paragraphs)</h2>

				<p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for <a href="#">various other purposes as well</a>, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements by default. It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>
				<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

				<p>This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, <a href="#">line height and spacing</a> to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool.</p>


	<hr>

				<h2>(Links)</h2>

				<p>This is a text paragraph that contains some inline links. Generally, inline links can be problematic from the usability perspective. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <a href="#">printing</a> and <a href="#">typesetting</a> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <a href="#">electronic typesetting</a>, remaining essentially unchanged.

				  <p>He said: <q>She said <q>Hello!</q></q> (a quotation inside a quotation)</p>
	-->


				  <p>You may get the message <samp>Core dumped</samp> at times (<code>samp</code> markup used for sample output)</p>
				  <p><small>This is not that important</small> (<code>small</code> markup used)</p>
				  <p><strong>This is highlighted text</strong> (<code>strong</code> markup used)</p>
				  <p>In order to test how subscripts and superscripts (<code>sub</code> and <code>sup</code> markup) work inside running text, we need some dummy text around constructs like x<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (where subscripts occur). So here is some fill so that you will (hopefully) see whether and how badly the subscripts and superscripts mess up vertical spacing between lines. Now superscripts: M<sup>lle</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, and then some mathematical notations: e<sup>x</sup>, sin<sup>2</sup> <i>x</i>, and some nested superscripts (exponents) too:  e<sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup> and f(x)<sup>g(x)<sup>a+b+c</sup></sup> (where 2 and a+b+c should appear as exponents of exponents).</p>
				  <p><u>Underlined</u> text (<code>u</code> markup used)</p>
				  <p>The command <code>cat</code> <var>filename</var> displays the file specified by the <var>filename</var> (<code>var</code> markup used to indicate a word as a variable).</p>

				<p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace font, often using the same presentation for all of them. This tests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>

				<ul>
				  <li><code>This is sample text inside code markup</code>
				  <li><kbd>This is sample text inside kbd markup</kbd>
				  <li><samp>This is sample text inside samp markup</samp>
